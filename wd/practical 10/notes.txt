types of machine learning :
- supervised :
    -regression :
        - idea : predict the value of a continuous output variable based on one or more input features .

    -classification :
        - idea : predict the value of a categorical output variable based on one or more input features .


- unsupervised :
    -clustering :
        - idea : group similar data points into clusters based on their features .

    - dimensionality reduction :
        - idea : reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information .
    
    - Anomaly ditection
        - idea : identify data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data (outlires).

    - association :
        - idea : identify relationships between variables in a dataset .

    - recommendation
    - deep learning

- semisupervised :
    - idea : use a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of a model
    - example : google photos 

-  reinforcement learning :
    - idea : learn from trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for

Batch learning :
- the model that is trained on the entire dataset at once.

online  learning :
- the model that is trained on a single data point at a time.
- prediction as well as trainig of the data at the time
- youtube
- incremental learning in the number of multiple small Batches

where to use :
- The program which is changes continuously changes whith rispect to time then online lea is more preferable (Stock market)
- cost effective
- fast in solution

how to implement : 
- from the linear model SDGRegressor method eith partial_fir()
- River library, vowpal wabbit

learning : 
- memorizing 
- generalizing 

MLDLC
- MLDLC is a process of developing and deploying machine learning models in a production environment.
- Frame the problem
- Gathering data
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model trainig, Evaluation and Selection
- Model deployment and monitoring
- Testing
- Optimize 

Feature engineering:
- Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract from raw data. These feature can used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithm.
